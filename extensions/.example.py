## AdHoc. To add adhoc option (now only for user settings and only boolean values supported)
## You need to add form field to GLOBAL_USER_SETTINGS
## Example: GLOBAL_USER_SETTINGS["setting_name"] = {"label": "field label", "value": "default-value", "type": "field-type"}
## For field types look http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html section 3.3 "Field Types"
## Ok now, look here.
GLOBAL_USER_SETTINGS["awesome_setting"] = {"label": "My new setting", "value": 0} ## If not type added, then boolean will be used
## Settings are being automatically saved as soon as they changed.
## To check if the value is equal to something, do:
## print user.settings.awesome_setting == 0
## where "user" is the User class object
